               A TINY BIT OF
           IMPORTANT INFORMATION

* * *  READ THIS BEFORE YOU CONTINUE  * * *

PLEASE read through these items.


1. IN A MOMENT YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A
LIST OF COMPONENTS.  NEVER DE-SELECT ANY OF
THE ITEMS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
Only advanced users who are "patching" an
existing copy and do not want certain files
overwritten should de-select the custom options.
If you de-select items without knowing what you
are doing, your copy may fail to work.

2. This is an early release and has not been
fully tested.  Some features do not work.
This is a consequence of the massive upgrade
work that has occurred during the past year.
My thinking is that I want all users to have
access to this release rather than wait even
longer.  It works great and is stable for all
general forecasting purposes.  I will be
releasing patches during the weeks and months
ahead.  Please visit our website and forums
to keep apprised of them!

3. If you are installing this on top of an
existing Digital Atmosphere workstation,
make a backup of your work if you have
customized any analysis script commands
(digatmos.mnu), Internet URLs, or station
tables.  They'll be overwritten!

4. Please direct all comments and question
(we'll monitor them there) to the Digital
Atmosphere forum at:
  www.weathergraphics.com/forum
You can work out problems you find with other
users there.

5. You should restart your computer so that
the meteorological font can be added properly
to your system.  Your computer may work fine
without this step, but if the station plots
look strange a reboot may be in order.

6. Read the help file for more information
(press F1 or look for the new Workstation help
document on our web site).

Have fun!
